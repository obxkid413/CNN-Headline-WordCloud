# CNN-Headline-WordCloud
This notebook shows how to use Beautiful Soup as well as the WordCloud library to see what words are most common among CNN website headlines.  This actually started out as a sentiment analysis whereby I used the Google Sentiment Analysis API or Language API to provide a sentiment score for each CNN contributor/journalist.  However, I decided to eventually go a different route and I think this is still a neat way to see what types of headlines CNN is putting out there.
